# BinGo
BinGo is a software solution designed for Define 2022 for the problem statement-"An Uber for Trash".

We have created a a place where people can get rid of their waste at home just with a click of a button. <br><br>

📌 We have planned out three sections for the following:<br>
1️⃣ User Application - request given by the end users whose trash has to be collected (completed)<br>
2️⃣ Collector Application - The person going to do the pick up of the trash. <br>
3️⃣ Admin Web App - admin to manage both users side and collectors side. <br>
<br><br>
